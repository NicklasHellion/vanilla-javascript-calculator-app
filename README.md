Vanilla JavaScript calculator

This is a calculator App built during the Epicode Bootcamp, I've created a new repository to highlight it after improving the code.

I used the CSS grid to display the buttons, I didn't use Bootstrap for this project as I'd rather get familiar with the grid logic.

This was an exercise to put in practice several javaScript concepts such as:

// arithmetic  && logical operators
// switch
// classes, constructors and parameters
// arrow function
// addEventListener, querySelector and this. keyword

Hope you like it!
